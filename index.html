                    <p data-aos="fade-up">I am a student of Information Technology who has always been passionate about learning new things and exploring new possibilities. I have had a remarkable academic journey so far, starting from my school days at St. Xavier's Institution, Panihati, where I completed my class 10 with an impressive 92% in ICSE board exams. I then moved to Bholananda National Vidyalaya, Barrackpore, where I continued to excel in my studies and secured 83% in class 12 CBSE board exams. Currently, I am pursuing Btech in information technology from Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology, where I am honing my skills and knowledge in various domains of computer science and engineering. I enjoy taking part in various co-curricular and extracurricular activities, such as coding competitions, quizzes, sports and cultural events. I also like to read books, watch movies and listen to music in my free time. I aspire to become a successful software engineer who can contribute to the society and the industry with innovative solutions and ideas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Apart from my academic pursuits, I have a wide range of hobbies and interests that keep me engaged and motivated. I love coding and creating portfolio websites, working on HTML, CSS and JS projects, and making small applications that solve real-world problems. I also have experience in working as a social media marketing intern, where I learned how to promote brands and products online. I enjoy writing blogs, technical articles, resumes and other forms of content that showcase my skills and knowledge. I am also fascinated by artificial intelligence and its applications, and I like to experiment with AI prompts and tools. In addition, I like to read books of various genres, watch anime and movies, and google random facts and trivia. I also spend some time on social media platforms, where I connect with like-minded people and share my opinions and insights.
